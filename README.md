# FizzBuzz

Fizzbuzz is a simple algorithm sometimes asked of junior developers.  This implementation of Fizzbuzz uses the case equality operator ('==='), which is used in case statements, in conjunction with lambdas.  The case equality operator makes a Proc#call on the right-hand side operand, which allows for interesting and useful behavior.
